              <h1>Introduction</h1>
              <article>
                <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                  JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming
                  language that is primarily used for client-side scripting on the
                  web. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at
                  Netscape Communications Corporation.
                </p>
                <h2>What is JavaScript Used For?</h2>
                <p>
                  JavaScript is used to add interactivity to websites, web
                  applications, and mobile applications. It allows developers to
                  create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, animate images, and
                  respond to user interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that
                    you don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using
                    it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Object-Oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming
                    (OOP) concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    First-Class Functions: JavaScript functions are first-class
                    citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other
                    functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in data
                    structures.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Prototype-Based: JavaScript is prototype-based, which means that
                    objects can inherit properties and behavior from other objects.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Why Learn JavaScript?</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ubiquity: JavaScript is used by most websites for client-side
                    scripting, making it a fundamental skill for web development.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Versatility: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and
                    back-end development, as well as for mobile and desktop app
                    development.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Job Prospects: Knowledge of JavaScript is a highly sought-after
                    skill in the job market, with a wide range of career
                    opportunities.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Getting Started with JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                  If you're new to JavaScript, start with the basics: learn the
                  syntax, data types, variables, control structures, functions, and
                  object-oriented programming concepts. Practice writing JavaScript
                  code using online tools like JSFiddle or CodePen. Explore popular

              <article>
                <h1>Variables: Storing and Reusing Values</h1>
                <p>
                  In JavaScript, variables are containers that hold values. They allow
                  you to store and reuse values throughout your code, making it more
                  efficient and easier to maintain. Variables can be declared using
                  three keywords: var, let, and const.
                </p>
                <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
                <p>
                  The var keyword declares a variable that can be reassigned and
                  redeclared within its scope. Let declares a variable that can be
                  reassigned but not redeclared within its scope. Const declares a
                  variable that cannot be reassigned or redeclared within its scope.
                  It's best to use const for values that don't change, let for values
                  that change, and avoid using var unless necessary for legacy browser
                  support.
                </p>
                <h2>Data Types and Variable Naming</h2>
                <p>
                  JavaScript has several data types that can be stored in variables,
                  including numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, objects, and
                  arrays. When naming variables, use camelCase (e.g., myVariable) and
                  avoid using reserved keywords (e.g., class, function). This helps
                  keep your code organized and easy to read.
                </p>
                <h2>Using Variables</h2>
                <p>
                  Once declared, variables can be used throughout your code. You can
                  assign new values to variables declared with let or var, but not to
                  those declared with const. Variables help simplify your code and
                  make it more maintainable. By using variables effectively, you can
                  write more efficient and effective JavaScript code.
