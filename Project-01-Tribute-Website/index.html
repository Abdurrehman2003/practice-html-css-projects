                <h2>Mohsin-e-Pakistan</h2>
                <p> <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city then in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal State, and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a Muhajir of Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin. His maternal ancestors hailed from the Tirah Valley (now in the Khyber District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) while from his paternal side he descended from an Uzbek soldier who came to India with Muhammad of Ghor, the 12th century conqueror, the reason why years later he'd name his ballistic missiles as Ghauri.

                His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a housewife with a very religious mindset. His older siblings, along with other family members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, who would often write to Khan's parents about the new life they had found in Pakistan.</p>
